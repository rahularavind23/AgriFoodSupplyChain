# AgriFoodSupplyChain

ABSTRACT:

Supply chains are evolving into automated and highly complex networks and are becoming an important source of potential benefits in the modern world. At the same time, consumers are now more interested in food product quality. 

However, it is challenging to track the provenance of data and maintain its traceability throughout the supply chain network. The traditional supply chains are centralized and they depend on a third party for trading. 

These centralized systems lack transparency, accountability and auditability. In our proposed solution, we have presented a complete solution for blockchain-based Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chain.


The Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a group of processes and sub-processes carried out for transforming raw material into a final product, maximizing customer value and achieving a maintainable competitive advantage . 

It is also interpreted as a network of entities that are part of the system from production to trading. The whole supply chain network is divided into several stages. Processes involved in these stages often take months to complete . 

In such situation, if the final product lacks in quality, it becomes extremely difficult to track the root cause of the problem. The demand for top quality products and interest of end consumers in the provenance of data is increasing rapidly. 

Therefore, it has become necessary for every supply chain system to track the movement of products from origin to the end consumers
